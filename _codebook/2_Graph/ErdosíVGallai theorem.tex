\begin{itemize}
\item A sequence of non-negative integers {$\displaystyle d_{1}\geq \cdots \geq d_{n}}d_1\geq\cdots\geq d_n$ can be represented as the degree sequence of a finite simple graph on n vertices if and only if {$\displaystyle d_{1}+\cdots +d_{n}}d_1+\cdots+d_n$ is even and{$\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{k}d_{i}\leq k(k-1)+\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}\min(d_{i},k)$}{$\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{k}d_{i}\leq k(k-1)+\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}\min(d_{i},k)$}
holds for every k in {$\displaystyle 1\leq k\leq n}1\leq k\leq n$.
